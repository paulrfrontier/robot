Frontier Technical Challenge

This project uses make to build the tests and program. Tested on linux only.

To run tests

make test && ./test

This program uses Catch as a simple unit testing framework. 
It is the single file version of catch, which can be found in the extras directory of the Catch github repo.
I did not include Catch as a submodule to keep it simple.

To clean

make clean

To run main

make && ./main

Make any required changes in the main function in main.cpp, recompile and run to see the robot in action.
